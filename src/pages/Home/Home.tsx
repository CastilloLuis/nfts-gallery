          <span>Hey you, who found this site. Welcome. Or not. I don’t care much. I am 19. I am a chick. And I draw. If you need my name, call me something like Dixie. Dicks, see? I recently ran out of gin and in the moment of misery, I wanted to express my feelings. I wanted to draw something easy, not too hard, but just hard enough. Something I could get my hand around and work with. Squeeze and twist it if I am angry. Something very close and dear to me. Something I am missing. Some…Thing! As a result, I am rather proud to introduce to you my very first public venture: </span>

        <h3>MY DICKS — The Seed Collection.</h3>
        If this collection or my words offend you, you are likely below the legal drinking age. In the US, and anywhere else in the world, for that matter. Your whole life is ahead of you. Congratulations. Don't fuck it up. Also, please stop reading and leave immediately before you are harmed beyond recognition.
        <br /><br />
        Why dicks, you may ask. Well, let’s say it just feels fitting. Last year, I went to art school to learn stuff, ya know, painting, sculpture—ART. Then my dear government shut it down. No more learning. Next, they shut down all the restaurants. My evening bartending part-time job—GONE, out the Wazoo. Despite that, I get them up to this point. But then they started printing money. Slowly and reliably, tons of it. Billions! For all the full-timers, the self-employed, freaking airlines for God’s sake, small corporations and giant ones, enterprises that didn’t need it. But students who once had part-time jobs—fuck ’em, right? Or slap them with a dick! So, thanks a shit ton for nothing. And yeah, these are for you, you bureaucratic pricks. They belong right up your ass. Made of splintering wood! It should feel good.
        <br /><br />
        My boyfriend was in a construction business. He always said that he likes things that grow in front of his eyes. I guess he meant it literally, ‘cause when dumped me in the middle of this mess, it was for a DUDE! Fuck me sideways! I don’t know what kind of a Johnson dangled in between his legs, but I hope they get a good rise out of each other. 
        I got left alone with my kitty. Charlie, I am so sorry that you won't be able to experience the joy of rolling on your back and licking your own balls. If I were a guy, I know I would. Probably never stop, either. You were a pussy with balls, but no more. Unfortunately, what had to be done, had to be done. Snip—I mean SNAP! I know that you don't care about my apologies, but please know that I was thinking of you when drawing one of these.
        <br /><br />
        I also drew one for you, Donald! I live far away from your MAGA circus, which made you quite an entertainment for me during the past four years. Every time you opened your twat-lips and tried to speak, I did not know if you were serious, if I should laugh, or if I should cry! Therefore, I just could not skip you. Next time, when the wind scruffs your hair, when Mel files for divorce and Stormy won’t put out, when Ivanka and Jr. abandon you, and nothing’s going right, grab a DICK by the shaft, gather these balls next to your own and try to convince yourself that it will be okay. 
        <br /><br />
        Oh, and of course, dear people of California! I had never heard of a thing called a "gender reveal party" before. In fact, even when you set your own forests on fire, my idea of what a gender reveal party was very misguided. I know trees are phallic, so why burn them! Nevertheless, your deep desire to see a DICK touched my heart—and maybe other parts. I personally prefer my DICKS grown up, strong, handsome, firm, and hairy. I also usually don't need fireworks with my party. But you clearly do! Have you thought of space lasers? So, here you go as well. Print it, frame it, set your own house on fire. Just go ahead and have a DICK blast!
        <br /><br />
        And now you, the readers who got through my rant all the way down to here, foreplay is fuckin’ over. It’s time to get into the groove, get over the hump, get your head around them so to speak, and begin. 
        <br /><br />
        I hope that you find MY DICKS—The Seed Edition entertaining, visually stimulating, or otherwise pleasing. This edition contains 24 DICKS. As in life, every single one of them is unique, drawn by my own hand in a mixed state of anger, misery, lust, entertainment, lack or excess of booze, and fond memories of some DICKS that gave me pleasure and some DICKS that I hated. Grab them by the dong like when Donald grabs them by the pussy!
